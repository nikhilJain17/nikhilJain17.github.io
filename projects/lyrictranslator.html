    <p>I made this project at Monthly Music Hackathon: Lyrics and Language. The theme of the hackathon was to make an app that involves using lyrics and language in a creative way. My team and I made an iPhone app that helps you learn songs in different languages. First, you pick which song you want to play from your phone and what language you want to learn. It was a VR app, so you put your phone in a Google Cardboard VR set. Then, the song would play and you would see the lyrics in the selected language pop up on the screen in realtime. You can check out the code <a style="color: cornsilk" href="https://github.com/nikhilJain17/LyricsTranslator">here.</a></p>
