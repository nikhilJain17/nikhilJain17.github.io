    <p>I built Drivr at ProfHacks 2016. We won 3rd Place and Best Quantified Self Hack. Drivr is a VR iOS app meant to keep you focused on the road. We used 3 pieces of hardware: a Muse headband, a Pebble smartwatch, and a Myo armband. The Muse headband measured your brainwaves to determine if you were focused on driving, and vibrated if it detected you were losing focus. The Pebble smartwatch determined through accelerometer data if you were swerving excessively, and alerted you through vibrations. The Myo armband tracked if you were holding the steering wheel, and flashed a warning if you weren't. It also allowed you to switch songs by moving your hand, meaning you didn't have to take your eyes off the road to change music. You can check out the code <a style="color: cornsilk" href="https://github.com/nikhilJain17/Drivr">here</a> and read an article about it <a style="color: cornsilk" href="http://www.nj.com/gloucester-county/index.ssf/2016/03/promising_hacks_from_rowans_first_hackathon_compet.html">here</a>.</p>
