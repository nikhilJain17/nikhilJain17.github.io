    <p>This was a Facebook Messenger bot I made in a few days to experiment with chatbots. It uses a node-js module to get lyrics from some songs. The chatbot looks at the last word you type, and randomly picks a line from a rap song. Then, it replaces the last word in the line with another word with the same part of speech that rhymes with your input. I hosted the bot on Heroku, a free cloud hosting service. Unfortunately, Facebook didn't approve it to go public, but you can still check out a short demo video on this page, and look at the code <a style="color: cornsilk" href="https://github.com/nikhilJain17/WHATS-UP-DAWG">here.</a></p>
