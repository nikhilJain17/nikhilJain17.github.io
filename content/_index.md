# Nikhil Jain

I’m a software engineer currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at UC Santa Cruz, after completing my B.A. in Computer Science at UC Berkeley and spending several years in industry. I previously worked at Uber on large-scale distributed systems and at SambaNova Systems as a compiler engineer for AI hardware. I returned to graduate school to focus on performance-critical systems for LLM inference and AI acceleration. My current work focuses on inference runtimes, including contributions to llama.cpp and building tinyLLM, a lightweight edge-focused inference runtime.
